StackEdit stores your documents in your browser, which means all your documents are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

> **Note:**

> - StackEdit is accessible offline after the application has been loaded for the first time.
> - Your local documents are not shared between different browsers or computers.
> - Clearing your browser's data may **delete all your local documents!** Make sure your documents are synchronized with **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** (check out the [<i class="icon-refresh"></i> Synchronization](#synchronization) section).
